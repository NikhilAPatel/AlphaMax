## Kalman Filtering
The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. In the context of modeling asset price dynamics, the Kalman filter serves to smooth asset prices by reducing the impact of noise present in the observed data. This smoothed representation of asset prices can help identify underlying trends and patterns, providing a reinforcement learning agent with a clearer understanding of market dynamics. By offering a less noisy estimation of asset price movements, the agent can make more informed decisions when interacting with the financial market.

## Fourier-based Spectral Estimation
Fourier-based spectral estimation techniques, such as periodogram, analyze time series data to identify significant cyclic components or frequencies that contribute to the overall signal. In the context of asset price dynamics, isolating these cyclic components can help uncover hidden periodic patterns that might be crucial in understanding the behavior of financial markets. By integrating Fourier-based spectral estimation into the observation space, a reinforcement learning agent can gain insights into the cyclical nature of asset prices, which can be valuable in generating more effective trading signals and strategies.

## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process used to model the dynamics of certain financial instruments, such as stock prices. In the context of asset price modeling, GBM serves as a simple and widely-used representation of the stochastic nature of financial markets. The GBM model assumes that the logarithmic returns of an asset follow a normal distribution with a constant drift and volatility. By incorporating GBM into the analysis, a reinforcement learning agent can better understand the random fluctuations of asset prices and adapt its strategies accordingly. While GBM is a basic model and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world asset price dynamics, it provides a foundation for understanding the stochastic behavior of financial instruments.
